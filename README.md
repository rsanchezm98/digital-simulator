# Digital simulator
Digital simulator of continuous systems implemented in MATLAB.

## Description
There are implemented simulator for both single and multiple equations systems. The list of implemented methods is:
* Euler
* Trapezoidal
* Adaptive trapezoidal
* Adams
* Runge Kutta 2 order
* Runge Kutta 4 order
* ode45
